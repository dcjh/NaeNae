# Optimised Patrolling System Management

## Project Overview
The Optimised Patrolling System Management is a web application designed to enhance the efficiency of law enforcement patrols by integrating crime hotspot analysis with patrol route optimization. Using K-Means Clustering and the Google Maps API, the system allows law enforcement agencies to prioritize high-risk areas and reduce emergency response times.

## Features
- **Crime Hotspot Analysis**: Visualizes past criminal location points on a map.
- **Patrol Route Optimization**: Calculates the most efficient patrol routes based on identified crime hotspots.
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Displays a heatmap of crime hotspots.
- **Interactive Map**: Provides various controls to show or hide patrol points, past criminal locations, optimized routes, and heatmaps.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side scripting to manage interactions and functionality.
- **Google Maps API**: Visualization and mapping tools.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Algorithm for identifying crime hotspots.

## Getting Started
